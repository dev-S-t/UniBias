# UniBias

## Vision

UniBias is a suite of tools designed to shield you from the endless distractions, biased narratives, and pervasive influences of the digital world. Our vision is to empower you to think freely, ensuring that your thoughts remain authentically yours and untainted by the constant stream of external information.

## Purpose

In today’s era of information overload and algorithmic curation, our minds are continuously shaped by external forces we may not even notice. UniBias aims to:

- **Minimize Digital Distractions:** Help you stay focused by reducing interruptions.
- **Counteract Biased Narratives:** Enable you to identify and filter out content that might sway your thinking.
- **Promote Intellectual Autonomy:** Provide tools that empower you to maintain mental clarity and independent thought.
- **Enhance Self-Awareness:** Assist you in distinguishing your genuine ideas from those influenced by digital content.

## Tools Included

UniBias offers a range of tools to support your journey towards enhanced mental clarity and focus:

- **Focus Tracker:** Monitors your digital activity and helps you stay on task (currently in progress—try it now!).
- **Content Analysis:** Evaluates the content you consume to identify potential biases (coming soon).
- **Digital Wellbeing Tools:** Assists in managing your digital consumption habits (upcoming).
