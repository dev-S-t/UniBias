# UniBias

## Vision

UniBias is a collection of various tools designed to keep the distractions, narratives, and influences of the internet away from you. The main vision of UniBias is to ensure that your thoughts are actually your own, unaffected by the constant stream of information and opinions that saturate the digital world.

## Purpose

In an era of information overload and algorithmic curation, our minds are constantly shaped by external forces that we may not even be aware of. UniBias aims to:

- Reduce digital distractions that fragment your focus
- Filter out biased narratives that might influence your thinking
- Provide tools to maintain your intellectual autonomy online
- Help you distinguish between your authentic thoughts and those influenced by digital content

## Tools Included

UniBias includes several tools to help you maintain mental clarity and focus:

- Focus Tracker: Monitors your digital activity and helps you stay on task (work in progess.. you can try it now!)
- Content Analysis: Identifies potential bias in the content you consume   (upcomming..)
